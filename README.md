# minesweeper

This will be a project where I write a program to simulate a game of 
Minesweeper and make a program to win the game. The game of Minesweeper will
be a standard game with the standard rules, and the program will use classic 
Minesweeper strategies/logic based reasoning to win the game (by revealing all 
the empty locations and flagging all of the bomb-planted locations.
